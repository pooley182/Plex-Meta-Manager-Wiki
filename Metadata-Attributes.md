Adding a metadata backup was one of the main reasons for creating this script. I wanted to be able to run a script and have my entire library be recreated if I lost my plex database, so I created this.

In order to edit the metadata of Movies or Shows in a library, you have to add it to the metadata mapping of that library.

Each movie/show is defined by the mapping name which must be the same as the movie/show name in the library name unless an `alt_title` is specified.

An example of multiple metadata edits in a show library is below:
```yaml
metadata:
  "Avatar: The Last Airbender":
    sort_title: Avatar 01
    seasons:
      1:
        title: "Book One: Water"
      2:
        title: "Book Two: Earth"
      3:
        title: "Book Three: Fire"
    episodes:
      S01E01:
        rating: 9.1
      S03E21:
        summary: The Epic Series Final of Avatar The Last Airbender
  "Avatar: The Legend of Korra":
    sort_title: Avatar 02
    alt_title: The Legend of Korra
    original_title: The Legend of Korra
    seasons:
      1:
        title: "Book One: Air"
      2:
        title: "Book Two: Spirits"
      3:
        title: "Book Three: Change"
      4:
        title: "Book Four: Balance"
```

The available attributes for each movie/show are as follows

### Special Attributes

| Name | Attribute | Allowed Values | Works with Movies | Works with Shows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Title | `title` | Title if different from the mapping value useful when you have multiple movies with the same name | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Alternative Title | `alt_title` | Alternative title to look for | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Year | `year` | Year of movie/show for better identification | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| TMDb Show ID | `tmdb_id` | TMDb Show ID to use for metadata useful for miniseries that have been compiled into a movie | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| Seasons | `seasons` | [`seasons` mapping details](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Seasons-Attributes) | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Episodes | `episodes` | [`episodes` mapping details](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Episodes-Attributes) | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |


* YAML files cannot have two items with the same mapping name so if you have two movies/shows with the same name you would change the mapping values to whatever you want. Then use the `title` attribute to specify the real title and use the `year` attribute to specify which of the multiple movies/shows to choose.
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      Godzilla1:
        title: Godzilla
        year: 1954
        content_rating: R
      Godzilla2:
        title: Godzilla
        year: 1998
        content_rating: PG-13
    ```

* If you know of another Title your movie/show might exist under, but you want it titled differently you can use `alt_title` to specify another title to look under and then be changed to the mapping name. For Example TMDb uses the name `The Legend of Korra`, but I want it as `Avatar: The Legend of Korra` (Which must be surrounded by quotes since it uses the character `:`):
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      "Avatar: The Legend of Korra":
        alt_title: The Legend of Korra
    ```
    This would change the name of the TMDb default `The Legend of Korra` to `Avatar: The Legend of Korra` and would not mess up any subsequent runs.
