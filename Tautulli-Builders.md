You can build different collections using the features of [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/).

[Configuring Tautulli](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Tautulli-Attributes) in the config is required for any of these builders.

It has watch analytics that can show the most watched or most popular Movies/Shows in each Library.

| Name | Attribute | Description | Works with Movies | Works with Shows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [Tautulli Popular](#tautulli-popularwatched) | `tautulli_popular` | Gets the Tautulli Most Popular List | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Tautulli Watched](#tautulli-popularwatched) | `tautulli_watched` | Gets the Tautulli Most Watched List | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Tautulli Popular/Watched
Both Tautulli Popular and Tautulli Watched have the same sub-attributes detailed below.

| Attribute | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| `list_days` | Number of Days to look back of the list | :x: | 30 |
| `list_size` | Number of Movies/Shows to add to this list | :x: | 10 |
| `list_buffer` | Number of extra Movies/Shows to grab in case you have multiple show/movie Libraries. | :x: | 10 |

If you have multiple movie Libraries or multiple show Libraries Tautulli combines those in the popular/watched lists so there might not be 10 movies/shows from the library to make your `list_size`.

In order to get around that, you can use the `list_buffer` attribute that defaults to 10. This will get that number more movies from Tautulli but only add to the collection until the size reaches the number in `list_size`.

So if your collection doesn't have as many movies/shows as your `list_size` attribute increase the number in the `list_buffer` attribute.

```yaml
collections:
  Most Popular Movies (30 Days):
    sync_mode: sync
    tautulli_popular:
      list_days: 30
      list_size: 10
```
```yaml
collections:
  Most Watched Movies (30 Days):
    sync_mode: sync
    tautulli_watched:
      list_days: 30
      list_size: 10
      list_buffer: 20
```
```yaml
collections:
  Plex Popular:
    tautulli_popular:
      list_days: 30
      list_size: 20
      list_buffer: 20
    tautulli_watched:
      list_days: 30
      list_size: 20
      list_buffer: 20
    sync_mode: sync
    summary: Movies Popular on Plex
    collection_order: alpha
```
