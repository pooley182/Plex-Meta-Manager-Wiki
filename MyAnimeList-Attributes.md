Configuring MyAnimeLit.net API is optional but is required for MyAnimeLit based collections to function. 

A `mal` mapping is in the root of the config file.

Below is a `mal` mapping example and the full set of attributes:
```yaml
trakt:
  client_id: ################################
  client_secret: ################################################################
  authorization:
    access_token:
    token_type:
    expires_in:
    refresh_token:
```

| Name | Attribute | Allowed Values | Default | Required |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Client ID | `client_id` | MyAnimeLit Application Client ID | N/A | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Client Secret | `client_secret` | MyAnimeLit Application Client Secret | N/A | :heavy_check_mark: |

* All other attributes will be filled in by the script. 

* To connect to MyAnimeLit.net you must create a Trakt application and supply the script the `client id` and `client secret` provided, please do the following:
1. [Click here to create a MyAnimeList API application.](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/create)
2. Enter an `App Name` for the application. Ex. `Plex Meta Manager`
3. Select `web` for `App Type`.
4. Enter an `App Description` for the application Ex. `Plex Meta Manager manages metadata and collections`
5. Enter `http://localhost/` for `App Redirect URL`.
6. Enter `https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager` for `Homepage URL`.
7. Select `non-commercial` for `Commercial / Non-Commercial`.
8. Enter any name under `Name / Company Name`.
9. Select `hobbyist` for `Purpose of Use`.
10. Agree to the API License and Developer Agreement and hit the `Submit` button
11. You should see `Successfully registered.` followed by a link that says `Return to list` click this link.
12. On this page Click the `Edit` button next to the application you just created.
13. Record the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` found on the application page.

* On the first run, the script will walk the user through the OAuth flow by producing a MyAnimeList URL for the user to follow. After following the URL and signing into MyAnimeList.net the user must authorize the application by clicking the `Allow` button which will redirect the user to `http://localhost/`. Copy the entire URL and paste it into the scrip and if the URL is correct then the script will populate the `authorization` subattributes to use in subsequent runs.

For docker users, please note that the docker container runs with the `--update` option and is designed for no user interaction. To authenticate Trakt the first time, you need run the container with the `-it` flags and run `plex_auto_collections.py` without the `--update` option and walk through the OAuth flow mentioned above. Once you have the Trakt authentication data saved into the YAML, you'll be able to run the container normally.
