```

## AniDB Relation
Gets all anime in the relation graph of the specified AniDB ID.

To see the relation graph of an anime use: `https://anidb.net/anime/<ANIDB_ID>/relation/graph` but replace `<ANIDB_ID>` with the AniDB ID you want to see the relations for.

The expected input is an AniDB ID, AniDB Anime URL, or AniDB Anime Relation URL. Multiple values are supported as either a list or a comma-separated string.
